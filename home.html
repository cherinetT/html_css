    The IoT is beginning to shape the future of many industries, by generating an unprecedented amount of data.

    <h2>
        A brief history of IoT and computing
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Internet of Things (IoT) essentially refers to an ecosystem of discrete computing 
        devices with sensors connected through the infrastructure of the internet. 
        The concept may have been bubbling away in the industry for a long time, 
        but the democratisation of computing technology through the availability and 
        affordability of small computing devices has now pushed it firmly into the mainstream. 
        So how did we get to this point?

        A brief trawl through the IoT’s evolution can be summed up quite simply as things getting smaller – 
        a cycle of minaturisation that began with computers the size of a room and ended up with a smartphone 
        in the palm of hands.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Consumerisation of IoT
    </h3>
    <p>
    With the advances in miniature computers and their increased affordability and availability, 
    along with miniature sensors, IoT was ripe for consumerisation. The issue standing in the way 
    of mass adoption of IoT as a paradigm outside of industry has been the control aspect.
    IoT devices represent rudimentary decentralised computing, they are individual self-contained 
    devices that can communicate and receive instruction from other computer devices.
    The issue is how do you tell them what to do, and how do you make use of the data that sensors are collecting? 
    Traditionally this had always required some kind of central computer to hold a rule set and act as a command and 
    control server.
    However, as the average consumer does not have the will or know-how to set up a control server in their house. 
    IoT would need to shake of much of this complexity to become a mainstream opportunity.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Leveraging mobile
    </h3>
    <p>
    As smartphones became near ubiquitous, it quickly became obvious that the perfect device to act as 
    this command and control server was the mobile that people always have on them.
    As a bonus, this device could gather additional context itself using its embedded sensors as well as user 
    location and behaviour. For example, your connected thermostat can know if you are home or not by using the 
    location of your phone. While using the phone as a control device is necessary it did prove lacking as the primary 
    control server.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Smart home
    </h3>
    <p>
    The traction around smart-home technology has been instrumental in cementing the IoT as a genuine consumer 
    proposition, due to an accessibility and advent of affordable IoT devices. Where it used to take a significant 
    investment in capital and labour to set up a connected smart home, now it is a matter of buying off the shelf 
    IoT devices and connecting them together.
    Almost any device you use in the home now has a connected smart version from light bulbs and thermostats to 
    tea kettles, fridges, and ovens. Additionally, devices that sense the state of a room are widely available in 
    the form of motion sensors, proximity sensors, thermostats, humidity sensors and more.
    The smart home market has settled on the hub approach to controlling your IoT devices which helps account for 
    the different people that use the devices.
    These hub type devices are being used to bridge the different communications protocols used by IoT devices and 
    hold and control the ruleset for the house from a central place in the home.

    ethernet and internet
</h3>
<p>
    <b>Ethernet</b> offers a standard way to link the computers via a wired connection to the network. It is an 
interface connecting multiple devices, like machines and switches.</br>
<b>Internet</b> is a digital network linking worldwide computer networks. With the aid of internet users can 
exchange information instantly. It facilitates the exchange of information and the provision of services 
such as file sharing, the World Wide Web and e-mail, pcs, routers, switches and other devices link to 
each other on the internet using cables or a wireless network or more sophisticated technologies such 
as fiber optics.
