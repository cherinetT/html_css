    Impacts of imput devices
</h2>
<p>
    As the designing world has become compulsory and more sophisticated to meet the needs of the 
environment and peoples it requires simpler and quicker form of inserting data. From the use of 
keyboard and mouse to touchscreen IPADs and light pens can be taken as an example.</p>
<p>
<b>3D scanners</b> capture every tiny detail of a material and transform it in to 3D model using building 
information modeling software. This helps the architect by saving time to reconstruct information of a 
prototype or model to make detail investigation and analysis. Not only for architects, but also for 
architecture teachers and students, it enables to make reliable examination on a model.

    Visiting the job site to collect information is still crucial in the 
design process. Project site visits are conducted to take notes, 
measure and snap photos. Today, mobile cameras capture 
location and measurements to within centimeter accuracy. 
The information obtained on site is immediately available to 
anyone with a network-connected device.

<h2>
    Impacts of processing devices
</h2>
<p>
    The advancements in technology in terms of software sophistication, computer processing speed and 
data storage capacity is increasing. The architecture and engineering industry is leveraging these 
advancements as much as any industry. Design software allows for the creation of more precise plans 
with the ability to automate many repetitive actions. Bilateral increment of the capacity of <b>Computer 
processing units</b>-(CPUs) and <b>Graphics cards</b> with respect to system requirement of these softwares 
allowed the architect to make use of the softwares with full potential and better designing capabilities.

<h2>Impacts of output devices</h2>
<p>
    Most of the time we herd of engineers referring to <b>virtual reality-(VR)</b> which puts the user in artificially 
rendered environment either for aesthetic or research purpose. And soon architects will be able to fully 
construct 3D representations of their work and use VR to put their clients into the experience before the 
first brick is laid. They can use 3d modeling software to show how the design look like, but to actually 
put on a headset and drape your senses with sound and space will make the spaces and materials 
instantly relatable and understandable. 
Designers are making use of advancements in <b>3D printing</b> and rapid prototyping to not only build better, 
more accurate design models, but to build full scale representations of their work. Currently simple 
structures or even an apartment is being built using 3D printing machineries
