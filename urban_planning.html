            Impacts of imput devices
        </h2>
        <p>
            In urban development there is numerous kind of input devices advised to be applied, by the urban 
planners. This input devises or detectors include vision sensors, radiation sensors, photoelectric sensors, 
humidity sensors, gas and chemical sensors, flame sensors and others which could play a role in the 
protection of the environment and consistent social security.</p><p>
As long as these sensors are used to capture the right information on streets, pavements, inside and 
around buildings we will have the right data to make a decision. It is forwarded by Mobeen Khan, 
Internet of Things practice leader at AT&T.<br></br><blockquote>
"More than 'big' data, it's about the right data. Especially around sensor technologies — it's 
about collecting the right information at the right time and acting upon it, he says"</blockquote>

            Impacts of processing devices
        </h2>
        <p>
            Urban planners can use modern technologies as well as open data to develop inclusive and vibrant
spaces for residents and businesses. Planning tools such as “National Equity Atlas” and “Metro Pulse”
assist in the urban design process and help to create areas that the inhabitants of a city need.

        <b>Virtual Reality:</b> Virtual reality is also helpful in simulating scenarios to model urban environments in 3D.
Through the use of advanced visualization techniques, urban planners can visualize different urban
areas. In this way, potential environmental impacts can be projected. This leads to better evaluations
and decisions.<br>
Cisco’s Vice President of Industry Solutions and Chief Globalization Officer WimElfrink agrees that the 
impact will be widespread.<blockquote>
"More and more cities understand the $3 trillion economic opportunity afforded by [the Internet 
of Everything], and they are taking actions to embrace features that provide greater 
engagement with citizens — smart parking, smart lighting, energy and waste management. 
From sewage systems and water treatment to the way we build highways or parking lots, smart 
tech — at least in theory — can streamline a city's infrastructure and potentially lead to higher 
efficiency and eco-friendliness.”</blockquote></p>
