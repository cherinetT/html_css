<h2>
    Impacts of input devices
</h2>
<p>
    Digital information has been showing a strong trend in the construction industry as the best way to help 
engineers foresee and solve problems. With the availability of advanced technologies, types of digital 
information grow rapidly, such as electronic documents and images, 3D information, and spatially 
oriented information archived by <b>global positioning systems</b> or <b>geographic information systems (GIS)</b>. 
Digital information brings critical information to the construction document management sector.</p><p>
Transition process of data identification and acquisition from a job site to a field office by using 
automated reality-capture technologies by using of automated reality capture technologies (laser 
scanners and radio frequency identification) can simplify the data collection process for the on-site 
construction.

<h2>
    Impacts of processing devices
</h2>
<p>
    Here again computers have enormous influence on construction processes. Companies will obtain the 
most value if they implement multiple digital levers in combinationâ€”for instance, a mix of digital tools, 
robotics, and advanced analytics.

<h2>
    Impacts of output devices
</h2>
<p>
    There is numerous output devices used for construction purposes, for instance theodolite, 3D printer, 
global positioning system, laser cutter, robotic products, etc.</p><p>
From these devices theodolite helps for measuring angles between designated visible points in the 
horizontal and vertical planes. And laser cutters are used under construction specially to cut metals
